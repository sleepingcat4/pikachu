# Pikachu

## Introduction

A personal initiative to create high-quality developer tools for compiling large datasets, programs, high-level wrappers, inference interfaces, and high-quality single- and multi-modal datasets. This open-source initiative will allow researchers and students to access open-source models and train artificial intelligence models with little knowledge and effort.

### What itâ€™s necessary?

The Artificial Intelligence field has amazing libraries and platforms that provide access to learning resources and models at ease. Unfortunately, developing and compiling datasets and access to certain state-of-art models for inference purposes are still black-box and knowledge scattered rather than being unified in one place. Pikachu is created to change that. It adds a level of simplicity and accessibility that was not available previously. 

Programming and exhausting tasks are left unto me and users enjoy high-level wrapper callings through 5-10 lines of Python code. 

### Progress

Progress is a bit slow-paced since developing tools and programs require time and certain domain-knowledge. That is not readily available oftentimes and a designing task from Software-side how to make the process seamless is a significant time-consuming task. 

Despite the challenges, I have made significant progress through multiple Open Source Python libraries, programs and datasets. 

#### Highlights

1. [Open Listen](https://pypi.org/project/open2listen/)
2. [Open Nougat](https://pypi.org/project/nougatop/)
3. Cyclic LLM (In-progress)
4. [Flask-K (In-progress)](https://github.com/sleepingcat4/wasteclassification)
5. Datasets
6. [Scrap 4Chan](https://pypi.org/project/scap4chan/)
7. [meta-translate](https://pypi.org/project/meta-translate/) 

Above mentioned a few are in-progress and rest are available online. 

### A few words (Datasets)

Datasets is a standalone technical project rather than an Initiative to release 200GB of high-quality and exotic domain datasets. We have already made significant strides and provide 2 High-quality datasets.

### Comments

>Academic and personal commitments do not allow me to release new updates and programs on a regular basis but the project is updated on a quarter basis. With small updates hitting occasionally depending on the situation.
